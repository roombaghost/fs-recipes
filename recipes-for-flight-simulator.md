### Sunset Chaser

Always try to catch the sunset. Pick places you know you’ll intersect it. Keep chasing it. (This recipe is also sometimes called "Endless Summer.")


### Novel

Time your reading to a flight. What’s the setting in your novel? Go to that place. Read for the duration it takes to get you there.


### Crush Journey

Take at the same time and place as your crush. So you're on airplane mode at the same time, going to the same "place." You’ll emerge from airplane mode at the same time. You could continue having airplane mode dates and dreaming of where to travel next.


### Morning Airplane Mode

Take a flight at night you know will last most of your sleep. Ideally, you’ll still be on the flight when you wake up for a while. This gives you time to consider how to approach your day peaceful in solitude. (This recipe is also sometimes called "Red Eye".)


### Big Sleep

Somewhat related to above recipe, but maybe more indulgent / luxurious. Choose somewhere very far away for when you know you want to get a lot of sleep.


### Special Chair

Maybe you have a special chair in your house. This could be your flight chair. Use it every time you take a flight. Don’t use it for anything else. Before you take off, make sure to get snacks and water ready next to your chair.


### Simultaneous Simulation

Maybe you’re about to take a real flight soon. In preparation, make sure to fly back to where you’re leaving from. (You will need to plan this, especially if you’re far away.) Then, as your real flight leaves, take off to your simulated destination at the same time. See how accurate the simulation is or isn’t. Enjoy the destination’s pin in a new way when you arrive, and let its vibe mix with the sensations of your real experience of that place.
